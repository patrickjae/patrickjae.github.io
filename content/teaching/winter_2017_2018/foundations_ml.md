## Lecture
I will give an introductory course on Machine Learning. Currently, the lectures take place on Tuesdays, 1:15pm - 2:45pm, this will eventually change if we get a larger room.

The course will cover:

* basics of Statistical Learning Theory,
* linear and non-linear regression and prediction models,
* the maximum likelihood principle
* overfitting, regularization and cross-validation
* Optimization
* binary classification, max-margin classifiers, SVMs,
* dimensionality reduction.

For this part, the recommended literature is _Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedmann: Elements of statistical learning, Springer, 2009_, the book is [available online](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/).

Additionally, we take a look at probabilistic Machine Learning as well:

* Clustering and Bayesian mixture models,
* Models of mixed membership,
* statistical inference,
* Gaussian process regression.

For this part, both of the following are nice reads:

1. Bishop: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Springer, 2006. 
2. Murphy: Machine Learning: A probabilistic perspective. MIT Press, 2012. 

## Exercises
Exercises are Tuesdays, 3:15pm and Fridays, 9:15am (duration depends on the amount of questions).
While I originally admitted 50 students to the exercises, I have over a 100 registrations. As I don't like kicking out students, I have decided to allow group work in the exercises _and_ not to correct the exercise sheets.
A group should consist of two members, one of which will be able to attend the exercise (you decide how to handle this).

I will publish a standard solution on the moodle page but still will require you to send in notebooks (I'll show you what that is in the lecture) on the practical parts of the exercises.
