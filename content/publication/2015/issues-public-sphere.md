abstract = "The goals of this article are twofold: First, we present a methodological approach to analyze the content-structure of a hyperlink-network representing a specific segment of an issue public in the US. Using the case of the food safety movement we demonstrate how to generate a hyperlink network with the web crawling tool Issuecrawler and merge it with results of a topic modeling process that we applied to the networks’ content data. Combining hyperlink network and content analysis allows us to interpret such a network in its entirety and with regard to different sub-issues. Second, our analysis is set up to explore issue-related mobilization potentials of the US food safety movement. By analyzing the online communication of NGOs and civil society actors in this sector we are keen to detect their specific communication strategies and on this basis develop hypotheses about issue-related mobilization potentials for further testing."
