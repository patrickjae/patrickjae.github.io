abstract = "The age of big data poses enormous challenges to traditional methods of empirical research (boyd & Crawford, 2012; Mahrt & Scharkow, 2013; Tinati, Halford, Carr, & Pope, 2014). This is experienced every­ day by communication researchers who seek to analyze political dis­ courses online. They have to deal with a seemingly endless amount of web sources. Content is produced at an ever­increasing rate, leading to massive amounts of text documents to be analyzed. Furthermore, texts are mostly unstructured and available in a variety of formats such as webpages, blog posts, or tweets. We experience an increasing volume, velocity, and variety of information that Laney (2001) summarized as the three Vs of big data. Additionally, online content is growing more com­ plex as it is interconnected through hyperlinks or hashtags (Booz Allen Hamilton, 2013). For this kind of web data, it is increasingly dif cult to apply estab­ lished methods of manual quantitative content analysis. Problems start with de ning units of analysis, identifying basic populations, or drawing representative samples before even proceeding to coding the data (for more challenges to online content analysis see Chapter 11). A different approach to analyzing text has been developed in compu­ tational natural language processing (NLP) (Feldman & Sanger, 2006; Heyer, Quasthoff, & Wittig, 2006; Manning & Schütze, 2003). NLP text mining methods allow the automatic capture of the semantics of texts in unstructured corpora. Massive populations of text documents can be analyzed with limited effort so that drawing restrictive samples is no longer necessary. Not surprisingly, more and more communica­ tion scholars explore the possibilities of these computational methods (e.g., Scharkow, 2013; Stieglitz, Dang­Xuan, Bruns, & Neuberger, 2014; van Atteveldt, Kleinnijenhuis, & Ruigrok, 2008). The aim of this chapter is to present the state of the art in text mining methods and discuss potential applications and limitations for political communication research. We proceed by introducing the basic approach of NLP, before we present an overview on speci c methods of text min­ ing. We conclude by discussing implications and future perspectives for political communication research."
