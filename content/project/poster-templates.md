For the upcoming poster presentations (and for general purposes), I have rebuilt some poster templates that I have found across the web. There is one Powerpoint template and three different latex templates (two based on the a0poster class and one based on the beamer class). All of the latex templates can be easily set to other formats (A0, A2, A3...) and to landscape instead of portrait.
Find the templates on [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/hotblack_desiato/poster-templates) and have fun ;-)
