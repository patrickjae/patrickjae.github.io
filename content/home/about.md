## Biography

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the machine learning group headed by [Marius Kloft](https://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~kloftmar/) at Humboldt-University of Berlin. My main research interests include machine learning algorithms for text mining (in particular topic modeling), scalable variational inference algorithms, Gaussian processes and I recently started to look into deep neural networks.
I received a PhD in natural language processing/machine learning from Leipzig University where my supervisor was [Gerhard Heyer](http://asv.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/en/staff/Gerhard_Heyer). Before that, I completed a Master's program at Leipzig University and a Bachelor's program at the University of Cooperative Education in Stuttgart including one term abroad at Staffordshire University's School of Computing. During my time in Stuttgart, I was also simultaneously employed by IBM Germany where I had the chance to visit IBM's Almaden research lab in San Jose, California.
