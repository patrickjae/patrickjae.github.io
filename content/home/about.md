## Biography

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Humboldt-University in Berlin. I'm currently part of the department of Knowledge Management in Bioinformatics headed by [Ulf Leser](https://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~leser/) and 
previously was at the machine learning group headed by [Marius Kloft](https://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~kloftmar/) who has now shifted to TU Kaiserslautern. My main research interests include machine learning algorithms high-dimensional data in general (texts, gene sequence data, images etc.), Bayesian probabilistic models (in particular topic models), scalable variational inference algorithms, Gaussian processes and Bayesian deep learning models.
I received a PhD in natural language processing/machine learning from Leipzig University where my supervisor was [Gerhard Heyer](http://asv.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/en/staff/Gerhard_Heyer). Before that, I completed a Master's program at Leipzig University and a Bachelor's program at the University of Cooperative Education in Stuttgart including one term abroad at Staffordshire University's School of Computing. During my time in Stuttgart, I was also simultaneously employed by IBM Germany where I had the chance to visit IBM's Almaden research lab in San Jose, California.
I also was enrolled at Princeton University as a Visiting Scholar Research Collaborator in Fall 2013. My superviser there was [David Blei](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/) (now at Columbia University).
